macai (macOS AI) is a simple yet powerful native macOS client made to interact with modern AI tools (currently, only ChatGPT is supported).

## Project status
The code still has weak structure and not documented. However, I'm working on improving it now. Initially, code was generated by ChatGPT, but most parts were rewritten/changed. Advises and contributions are welcomed.

## Contributions
Contributions are welcomed. Take a look at [macai project page](https://github.com/users/Renset/projects/1) and [Issues page](https://github.com/Renset/macai/issues) to see planned features/bug fixes, or create a new one.
