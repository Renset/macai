## Run with ChatGPT, Claude, xAI or Google Gemini
To run macai with ChatGPT or Claude, you need to have an API token. API token is like password. You need to obtain the API token first to use any commercial LLM API. Most API services offer free credits on registering new account, so you can try most of them for free.
Here is how to get API token for all supported services:
- OpenAI: https://help.openai.com/en/articles/4936850-where-do-i-find-my-secret-api-key
- Claude: https://docs.anthropic.com/en/api/getting-started
- Google Gemini: https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/api-key (free models available ðŸ”¥)
- xAI Grok: https://docs.x.ai/docs#models
- OpenRouter: https://openrouter.ai/docs/api-reference/authentication#using-an-api-key (> 50 free models ðŸ”¥)

If you are new to LLM and don't want to pay for the tokens, take a look Ollama. It supports dozens of OpenSource LLM models that can run locally on Apple M1/M2/M3/M4 Macs.

## Run with [Ollama](https://ollama.com)
Ollama is the open-source back-end for various LLM models. 
Run macai with Ollama is easy-peasy:
1. Install Ollama from the [official website](https://ollama.com)
2. Follow installation guides
3. After installation, select model (llama3.1 or llama3.2 are recommended) and pull model using command in terminal: `ollama pull <model>`
4. In macai settings, open API Service tab, add new API service and select type "ollama":
